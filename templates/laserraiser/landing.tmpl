<h2>Help a hackerspace (<a href="#" id="tldr">TL;DR</a>)</h2>

<p>Revelation Space, the hackerspace in The Hague, needs a laser cutter! A bit more than a year has passed since receiving the key to our space, and we are quite settled in. The validity of the concept has been proven. We now have a shop with a nice array of basic tools, and are ready for the next step.</p>

<p>A laser cutter is basically a high-intensity laser beam that can cut through wood, acrylic and even thin steel. The beam can be turned on/off and moved in 2d in a very precise manner. It allows us to cut custom-made parts and all kinds of shapes from a variety of materials. At low intensities it can also engrave picture and texts. We have set our aim for a FILL-IN-PRODUCT-NAME, which has SUCH-AND-SO-FEATURES. With this piece of equipment, we can further our creative endeavors in ways we can not even imagine yet.</p>

<h2>How to help</h2>

<p>A laser cutter is a very expensive machine. The cheapest but riskiest option is a DIY laser cutter which will set you back roughly EUR 4000,- and the really cool ones are produced by Epilog but will set you back about EUR 20.000,-. In between are mostly Chinese built cutters, which we think is right now the cheeps way to get a working solution. We can manage part of the cost among us, but are collecting donations to help pay for the laser cutter. This is to add to the amount collected from our members and sponsors. Our end goal is to collect a total amount of EUR 6500,-, the cost of a IEHK IE900. You can pledge any amount you see fit towards reaching this goal. We will only collect the actual euro's once we have reached the desired amount. If we fail to get enough pledges before July 31st, we will abort the mission and not collect any money. In case you all pledge an amount surpassing what we need to obtain the lasercutter, the surplus will go towards a vinyl cutter and/or a lathe.</p>

<h2>What's in it for me??</h2>

<p>A valid question indeed! The most important return you get is our eternal gratitude and the knowledge that you have increased the means to transform our imagination into reality (or well, at least until the tube burns out). To immortalize this gratitude, the very first job for the new lasercutter will be to engrave a plaque listing the names (or whatever identification you want) of our beneficiaries. Said plaque will be mounted against the wall above the laser cutter. Next to that, we have several gifts for our generous friends:</p>

<ul>

	<li>For donations between EUR 25,- and EUR 100 you will receive a somethingsomething;</li>
	<li>For donations between EUR 100 and EUR 250 you will receive a somethingmoresomething;</li>
	<li>For donations above EUR 250 you will receive yet something more awesome. </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these gifts will involve application of the lasercutter.</p>

<h2>About Revelation Space</h2>

<p>Revelation Space was founded mid-2009 and moved into the current space in December 2009. Currently the space has over 40 paying participants from The Hague, Rotterdam, Delft and Zoetermeer. The ambition is to double this number by the end of 2011. In its short existence, the space has hosted several events such as a GNU Hackers meetup, "Echte Hackers", Guadec social events and the Dutch Perl Workshop. It acts as a hub and meeting place for community-related groups around the country and beyond. National media have covered the hackerspace, both in printed media, on the web and on television. With a radio studio, a tool shop, electronics lab, library, dark room and general purpose area the 400 square meters are optimally used for a diverse array of activities. For an overview of current projects, we refer the reader to our project page on the RevSpace? wiki.</p>

<p>Revelation Space is part of a global movement of loosely connected groups with roughly the same interests. Although there are a lot of differences in the way the various hackerspaces around the world operate, they tend to share a common mind-set of experimentation, innovation and creativity. It is a place were warranties are voided. We study electronic and mechanical equipment, processes and even human culture. We try to understand, and improve.</p>
